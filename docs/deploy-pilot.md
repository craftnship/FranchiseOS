# Deploying the pilot (Development)

Run these on a computer with Node 20+ and the repo cloned.

1. Install and sign in to the Catalyst CLI (once):
   ```
   npm install -g zcatalyst-cli
   catalyst login
   ```
2. Put the function secrets in `catalyst/env.local.json` (copy `catalyst/env.example.json`).
   The file is gitignored; never commit it.
   - `fos_api` and `fos_webhooks`: `ZOHO_CLIENT_ID`, `ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN`
     (a Self Client from api-console.zoho.in; refresh token with scopes
     `ZohoCRM.modules.leads.ALL,ZohoCRM.modules.accounts.ALL,ZohoCRM.modules.contacts.ALL`)
   - `fos_webhooks`: `FOS_CRM_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, a long random string (letters and digits)
3. Build and deploy:
   ```
   git checkout claude/api-step1
   npm ci
   cd catalyst && catalyst project:use && cd ..   # pick FranchiseOS, Development
   npm run deploy:functions                        # or: npm run package:functions && node scripts/deployFunctions.mjs fos_webhooks
   ```
   A plain `catalyst deploy` with an empty `env_variables` in `catalyst-config.json` wiped the values
   entered in the console (seen on 9 Oct). The committed configs no longer list `env_variables`, and
   the script fills them from `env.local.json` for the deploy only, then restores the committed config,
   so the values survive either way.

The CRM webhook ("CRM Lead") posts to `/server/fos_webhooks/webhooks/crm/lead/STARK` with custom
parameter `x-fos-webhook-secret` and module parameter `lead-id` (Leads > Lead Id). CRM sends these as
headers, and header names with `_` are dropped on the way in, so use the hyphen.

The Stark Industries tenant already has its `tenant_integrations` row (provider ZOHO, data center IN);
the function reads the refresh token and webhook secret from these env variables for the pilot.

After the deploy, the API Gateway routes and the CRM workflow rule are set up from the project thread.
